# Authentication Fix - Deployment & Testing Guide

## üö® Critical Issue Fixed

The main issue was in the backend authentication function `get_user_from_token` in `backend/app/main.py`. It was defined as `async` but used as a dependency in `Depends()`, which caused authentication to fail silently.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `async def get_user_from_token` to `def get_user_from_token`
- Updated token expiration from 30 minutes to 1440 minutes (24 hours) in production

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend
```bash
# Commit and push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix authentication: make get_user_from_token synchronous and extend token expiration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Normal Browser Window
1. Open your deployed application in a normal browser window
2. Register a new account or login with existing credentials
3. Create an experiment
4. Navigate to dashboard
5. **Expected Result**: Should stay logged in and show experiments

### Test 2: Incognito/Private Window
1. Open your deployed application in an incognito/private window
2. Register a new account or login with existing credentials
3. Create an experiment
4. Navigate to dashboard
5. **Expected Result**: Should stay logged in and show experiments

### Test 3: Cross-Device Testing
1. Test on a different device (phone, tablet, different computer)
2. Login with the same account
3. **Expected Result**: Should work consistently across devices

## üîç Debugging Steps

If issues persist, check the browser console for:

### Frontend Debug Info
```javascript
// Check localStorage
console.log('Token:', localStorage.getItem('token'));
console.log('User:', localStorage.getItem('user'));

// Check API calls
// Look for 401 errors in Network tab
```

### Backend Debug Info
```bash
# Check backend logs for authentication errors
# Look for "Invalid authentication credentials" or "Invalid token" messages
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Testing Script

Run the test script to verify backend authentication:

```bash
# Install requests if needed
pip install requests

# Run the test script
python test_auth_fix.py
```

## üìã Checklist

- [ ] Backend deployed with authentication fix
- [ ] Frontend deployed with updated API configuration
- [ ] Tested in normal browser window
- [ ] Tested in incognito/private window
- [ ] Tested on different device
- [ ] Verified token expiration is 24 hours
- [ ] Checked browser console for errors
- [ ] Verified localStorage persistence

## üîß Additional Fixes Applied

1. **Token Expiration**: Extended from 30 minutes to 24 hours
2. **ESLint Warnings**: Fixed React Hook dependency warnings
3. **Error Handling**: Improved token validation and error messages

## üéØ Expected Behavior

After the fix:
- Users should remain logged in for 24 hours
- Authentication should work consistently across browsers
- No more redirects to login page after successful authentication
- Tokens should persist in localStorage properly
